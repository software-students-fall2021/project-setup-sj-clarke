# Project Repository: TripSplit

## Project Description

TripSplit is a web application that makes splitting expenses during vacations, events, or day to day activities easy to keep track of and less tedious. We want to elimite the stress and frustration associated with this process and make our users lifes easier. Once on the TripSplit web application, users will be able to create a group, which they can add friends who also have TripSplit accounts to. Once a trip is created, all users who have access to this trip can create expenses. When a trip is first created, each member of the group will have 0 balances due. However, when payments begin to be created and split between members of the group, balances will be created for each person within the group that the user owes money to. For example, if I was on a trip with 5 my friends and one person named Sarah covered dinner for $500. After dinner Sarah will create this expense on her TripSplit account within the TripSplit group, input $500 as the total payment, add all 4 of us to the payment, and once the payment has been created, under our balances we will see a new entry that says we owe Sarah $100. These balances will constantly be updated as new payments are created or even deleted throughout the trip. 


## Product Vision Statement

## History of project idea 

This project idea sparked when our group was brainstorming project ideas and started thinking of tedious tasks in our lives that could be less tedious with the use of technology. We began to discuss how hard it can be to keep track of how much money you owe people and who owes you money when you are participating in a lot of transactions during a vacation or actvity with a group of people. It can be frustrating if you do not get all the money back that you spent covering other people at dinner or other events. Thus, TripSplit was proposed.
